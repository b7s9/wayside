// INTRODUCTION
// --------------------------------
=== intro ===
	The shore of the mottled lake is an unlikely meeting spot for friends, allies, or even acquaintances – but for the wanderers and vagrants of the Froglands, it almost feels like home.

	Some countless centuries ago, the world was struck by misfortune; in the days after, its people diminished, faded, and were replaced by new people – people of a different kind.

	Few of those that wander the new world carry the legacy of the old; they carry strange mutations, grimy haversacks, and interminable feelings of anxiety.

	There are few places to find comfort in the Froglands; walled communes and isolationist tendencies are common, and few are trusted to join the larger groups. It's safer that way.

	But on the shore of the mottled lake, on the wayside of a seldom-walked trade route, there is a place to sit, talk, and perhaps find camaraderie…

// Littimer
// --------------------------------
=== littimer ===
	As you sit at the pyre, soaking in its subtle warmth, you begin to feel the sometimes-familiar sensation of curious eyes burrowing into you.

	You look around for a sign of the mystery observer, but there doesn't seem to be anyone around. There's just the quiet sound of the wind, and the lapping of the lakewater against the mossy islands.

	You turn your head back to the pyre, and there it is. Staring at you.

	@audioPlay:looking-frogward-to-the-end
	@image:littimer

	The creature doesn't say anything when you express your surprise at its sudden appearance. It just smiles.

	After a moment, your eyes are drawn to the creature's one item of clothing: a pair of blue, denim shorts. They notice you noticing, and flap their fins against their tummy in excitement.

	Finally, they say something.

	@chatStart:littimer_neutral
	You like my jawts?

	@chatEnd:null

	It's a question that's hard to answer. You've not seen anything quite like it before - such scandalously short shorts are certainly not the fashion in any of the communes you've visited.

	But there's a local rumour, some story you've heard about a person like this - something about a wasteland wanderer with a peculiar eye for style.

	You meet that peculiar eye – just one of them, since the creature's fish-like body means they have to stand slightly side-on in order to see you – and answer their question.

	Do you like their jawts?

	* [“Yes.”] -> littimer_choice_yes
	* [“No.”] -> littimer_choice_no

=== littimer_choice_yes ===
	They curl the sides of their gawping mouth like a feasting sturgeon – you think that's a smile – and pat their tummy again, excited.

	@chatStart:littimer_intense
	Littimer loves the joornts. Supercool!

	@chatEnd:null

	-> littimer_end

=== littimer_choice_no ===
	The fish-man seems saddened, and for a moment you're worried that honesty was not the best policy. But then they speak.

	@chatStart:littimer_sad
	That's okay. Littimer likes them. Good enough for Littimer.

	@chatEnd:null

	-> littimer_end

=== littimer_end ===
	A peaceful moment passes, and the mood between you seems to lighten up. Littimer doesn't seem like a threat. Just another traveller, looking for the warmth of a pyre.

// Coffin
// --------------------------------

=== coffin ===
	~ decorationCount += 1

	You find yourself drifting in and out of sleep as the long night drags on. That is until the sound of the sound of grinding metal and clanking pierces the peaceful ambience.

	It's easy enough to locate the source. Down by the water, beyond the mossy berms, a grey-blue box rocks in the gentle laketide.

	@audioPlay:coffin

	@image:coffin

	The thing is big and square and sealed tight, with something like a porthole at the top of its front face. It almost looks like a piece of old-tech – something you'd expect to find in the collection of the salvopriests.

	Maybe it's worth something, but it's far too huge to move without the aid of some sort of crane. It's strange, given its weight, that it was seemingly able to wash up on the shore at all.

	You wonder what its purpose is. Perhaps some kind funerary box? It seems like it has the right proportions for a coffin. But how did it get here? And if it is a coffin…is there someone inside?

	On further inspection, you find a frayed black rope around the midsection of the box; it leads down into the water, so you try pulling on it. That action quickly reveals that there's something attached on the other end. You keep pulling.

	What emerges from the water is a ragged fishing net, containing a peculiar catch: a bundle of crates. Tough plastic cubes, sides smeared with muck from the lakebed as if they had been used as dredging tools.

	With a little effort, the lids pop open, and their contents are revealed: in each, a mass of green moss – like a protective layer for the real treasure underneath.

	Beneath the squelchy moss layer are dozens and dozens of books, packed neatly, but waterlogged and stained. As you lift them from their watery caskets, some of them come apart in your hands, turning to valueless mush.

	There are a few that can be salvaged – those that were protected from the moisture by virtue of being tucked beneath a dozen soggier books, a couple in watertight bags, some with laminated pages.

	But in all of them, the crinkled pages are filled with runes and symbols you don't recognise. Some forgotten language – nothing new.

	Still, they're pretty to look at. So engaging, in fact, that as you're flipping through the pages, you almost don't notice the rope tighten, and the net begin to slide.

	For a second, it seems as if the crates are moving on their own…until you hear it again: the sound of grinding metal.

	You turn, and can't quite believe your eyes. The coffin is moving. Walking.

	Somehow, whilst you were distracted, the thing must have managed to lift itself up from the silt. On stubby little legs, the metal box, the coffin, machine – whatever it is – has made it halfway up the berm.

	You quickly catch up to it, but as soon as you do, a red light flashes from its porthole, and it drops down like a stone, telescoping the hidden legs back into its body.

	The sudden, panicked movement imparts a shake on the top-heavy automaton's body, and on the unsteady ground, it keels to the side, slamming into the wall of the nearby ruin with a heavy thud.

	Then, it stays there. Silent.

	You wait for it to move again, but it doesn't.

	As you collect the salvageable books, you keep a careful eye on the walking box. But still it remains dormant, as if embarrassed, scared or broken.

	Eventually, you give up waiting for it to wake, and try to go back to sleep. You drift off, and expect it to be gone when you open your eyes. But it isn't…so there's little else to do but accept its presence.

	Perhaps, one day, a passing traveller might offer some insight into what this thing is, or be able to decipher the unknown code in the books it brought. But for now, the walking coffin slumbers.

	It’s a peaceful night, and the nocturnal denizens of the area are out and about, filling the air with their various calls and croaks – mostly croaks. You decide to close your eyes and contemplate the soundscape for a time, letting it all soak in.

	Then, suddenly, you hear a voice cutting through the ambience.

	@chatStart:jude_neutral
	Is that a CAMPYRE!?
	@chatEnd:null

You try to ignore the commotion and keep your eyes closed. But then you hear a rhythmic series of huge, loud splashes approaching your position. You open your eyes and peer out across the misty darkness of the lake, and see the shape of a large creature barreling towards you.

	@audioPlay:bubbly
	@image:ljs

	@chatStart:lexis_neutral
	SLOW DOWN, JUDE!
	@chatEnd:null

	The massive creature clumsily skids to a halt, kicking up a wave that falls just shy of extinguishing your pyre. In the firelight, the creature is revealed to be covered head to toe in long, thick fur. It’s an unusual sight – most creatures you've seen have only frequent patches of fur at most.

	With the added light you can also confirm what you thought must have been a trick of the light or tiredness: the creature has two heads.

	The head on the left moves to speak with an excited expression.

	@chatStart:jude_neutral
	HIYA! CAN WE SIT BY YOUR CAMPYRE?!
	@chatEnd:null

	Their voice is almost deafeningly loud. With how big they are, even speaking softly would be quite loud, but on top of that they seem to be yelling out of excitement.

	@chatStart:lexis_neutral
	Jude. Inside voice, remember?
	@chatEnd:null

	@chatStart:jude_neutral
	Oh! O-oh…right.
	@chatEnd:null

	After the reminder from the head on the right, the left head – Jude, apparently – speaks again in a plenty-audible whisper.

	@chatStart:jude_neutral
	Ahem. Can we sit by your campyre?
	@chatEnd:null

	You indicate that yes, they certainly can. You're wary, but this person – or rather, these people – seem to be well-meaning. Besides, if they wanted to do you harm, it would surely have been done by now.

	@chatStart:lexis_neutral
	Sorry for that sudden entrance. Allow us to introduce ourselves.
	@chatEnd:null

	@chatStart:lexis_neutral
	I’m Lexis – but you can call me Lex.
	@chatEnd:null

	@chatStart:jude_neutral
	I’m Jude!
	@chatEnd:null

	@chatStart:lexis_neutral
	And this here is Sparks.
	@chatEnd:null

	@chatStart:sparks_neutral
	...
	@chatEnd:null

	Lex indicates their tail and, to your surprise, it waves at you. It seems to have a mind of its own, and occasionally fidgets with the creature’s paraphernalia or their surroundings.

	@chatStart:lexis_neutral
	We’re explorers, just passing through these parts.
	@chatEnd:null

	The tail – Sparks – seems to perk up, as if remembering something, and taps Lex's shoulder.

	@chatStart:lexis_neutral
	Oh! Right! We're looking for food—
	@chatEnd:null

Lexis looks backward at Sparks.

	@chatStart:lexis_neutral
	…aaand, uh, study material – mushrooms, specifically. For both things.
	@chatEnd:null

	@chatStart:jude_neutral
	We can only eat mushrooms! And Sparks here loves studying 'em!
	@chatEnd:null

	You notice the wicker basket hanging on their side, full of mushrooms of all kinds – many you've never seen before. You tell them about the best spots you know of in the area for finding mushrooms.

	@chatStart:lexis_neutral
	That sounds great! Thanks for the help!
	@chatEnd:null

	@chatStart:jude_neutral
	But we're not leaving yet, right? We're staying by the campyre? At least a little longer?
	@chatEnd:null

	@chatStart:lexis_neutral
	Yes, I'm fine with staying here tonight, as long as we’re welcome…
	@chatEnd:null

	Lex indicates to you as they say this, and you have no objections. These people seem quite pleasant, if sometimes rowdy.

	@chatStart:lexis_neutral
	And Sparks, you're fine with it?
	@chatEnd:null

	@chatStart:sparks_neutral
	…
	@chatEnd:null

	Sparks gives an enthusiastic thumbs-up, and with that, it's settled. Your new friends settle in, lying down on their four legs facing the pyre.

	Lex almost immediately yawns and lays their head down to sleep, Jude stays up, her eyes transfixed by the glowing campyre, and Sparks pulls out a notebook and pencil from a pocket on their side and starts writing. It's a peaceful scene, and soon you find yourself drifting off into a dreamy sleep...

	You overheard some locals mention that the Salvopriests are coming by this area today to perform a Salvo Raising.

	You know only a little about the Salvopriests – heard bits and pieces of their doctrine from followers in the area or passing by. They have a monastery not too far from here, and occasionally come by to help repair huts and tents after great storms and other calamities.

	The tower near your pyre and a couple other structures in the area were Raised by the priests, but you’ve never seen a Raising actually take place. You decide that you might go check it out, if it isn’t too far out of the way.

	@audioPlay:salvopriests

	In the afternoon, an unusual sound starts to fill the air. It’s very subtle at first – very distant – but it’s getting closer.

	It’s a harmonious, low droning, interlaced with rhythmic chantings of – so far as you can tell – gibberish.

	It takes you a little while to make the connection, but you become sure that the sound is the ritual chanting of the Salvopriests.

	As it gets closer, you decide to move from your regular spot at the pyre and go take a look.

	Sure enough, just over the hills, you spot a procession of about twenty creatures of varying sizes, all wearing the distinctive blue robes of the Salvopriests. They’re walking, slowly and steadily, in the direction of the camp.

	Many locals are following alongside the procession, some watching with genuine interest, some laughing and jeering, and some joining the chant – either mockingly or reverently.

	The priests – who, the last time you saw them, were very jovial and personable, have their hoods up and heads down, acting as though nobody else was around. It’s clear that they believe their ritual requires utmost reverence and focus.

	A good number of the younger creatures alongside the procession are doing their best to try and make the priests flinch or break form. They’re making a game out of it and having much fun. The priests, however, don’t flinch.

	Before you know it, the procession has reached your location, along with all the locals following them. It’s a lot more people than you’re used to being here, and you feel very nervous with such a big crowd.

	The procession continues forward, going past the camp and wading out into the water, where the most persistent hangers-on finally break off and hang back to watch with the crowd. The Salvopriests definitely aren’t walking on the water, but you could swear they aren’t sinking nearly as deep as they should be.

	The Salvopriests form a circle around a spot a ways into the water, and they finally stop chanting with a decisive shout on the last beat.

	All is still for a few moments.

	Then, the largest of the priests starts to produce a very low, very quiet note that gradually increases in volume. It’s at this point that you notice that the priests are lined up from largest to smallest.

	The second largest priest starts a slightly higher note, harmonising with the larger priest. Again, it’s very quiet at first and gradually grows louder.

	This pattern continues around the circle, with each priest being smaller than the last and each singing a higher note. With each voice added to the chorus, there is a distinct change in the air – it becomes dense and electric with energy.

	As the turn for the priests to sing passes to the smaller individuals, a swirl of blue, flowing energy starts to form over the water at the centre of the circle.

	When the smallest priest begins their note, the energy flashes outward, and sends a shockwave that kicks up waves and gusts of wind.

	Then, the blue energy starts to shoot up in branching, triangular patterns, forming a web that shoots high up out of the water. It’s an unstable formation at first, but the energy starts to converge on a particular permutation.

	Starting from below the water and moving upwards, the energy gradually condenses. It turns in on itself, creating endless, complex folds until what you see is no longer a web-like trace, but a metallic surface. At three points on the structure, on the tips of triangles, there form hanging, beaded decorations of a different material.

@image:pylon

	Where, just seconds ago, there was nothing but open air and water, there now stands a towering metal structure of undeniable beauty.

	The Salvopriests, now finished with their ritual, stand back and start to adopt more relaxed postures once again. It’s as if a spell has been broken, and their autonomy has been returned to them.

	The priests look upon the recovered structure with more awe and reverence than a mother might give their own child.

	Barely a word is spoken as the gathered spectators slowly peel off and return to their homes. The priests stay around the structure for a little longer, but one by one, start to wander back toward the monastery.

	You are left in awe, and find yourself staring at the ancient structure for longer than you realise.

	It’s night before you break your gaze, and all is quiet.

=== jellychair ===
	A few hours pass.

	The calm of the night is shattered by a litany of screams.

	The voices are close, just beyond a cluster of dry underbrush at the edge of the camp. It sounds like they're in pain, but at points it almost sounds like pleasure.

	Whatever is happening, it's unnerving. The whole episode takes a few minutes to abate, and by that time you've armed yourself with a sturdy-looking stick.

	It takes a few moments to work up the courage to look, but beyond the dry hedgerow, the aftermath of whatever commotion is revealed.
	
	@audioPlay:jellychair
	
	Out there, beyond the safety of the pyrelight, there's a cluster of dead trees that glow with a dim blue light. Just in front of the trees, there's a patch of ground littered with detritus.

	There's a dozen items strewn about: haversacks, blankets and other travelling equipment, along with other personal items. And, at the centre of the debris field, there's something odd.

	It looks like a blob of pink jelly, about the size of a chair. It's translucent, squat and wide – and at the rear, there's some sort of handcrafted structure made of intersecting pieces of wood.

@image:jellychair

	The more you think about it, the more the blob looks like a chair. It looks extremely comfortable. A soft, malleable surface that would perfectly cushion your backside, and a rigid back to keep your back straight. The perfect balance.

	But what happened here, in the clearing? Where did all the random items come from, and who was screaming? Why were they screaming?

	As you contemplate these questions, the warmth of the pyre starts to seem far more hospitable than the cold, threatening landscape beyond the camp, so you play it safe. It's too much to figure out right now.

	You move around the strange chair, gathering up the most useful salvage you can find. Every so often, you think you hear something and look up, but there's no-one around.

	When you have everything together – a few jars of pickled vegetables, some blankets, and a dozen other little trinkets – you make your way back to camp. But something stops you. You turn back to look at the chair.

	Before you know it, you're dragging the blob-thing back to the camp. Gripping the backrest, it comes easily enough – the thing is much lighter than one would expect.

	You place it on one of the berms overlooking the pyre. It seems like the right spot. You wouldn't want it to get cold.

	Over the next few hours, you keep looking over at it. It really draws the eye – like it's the perfect addition to the campsite.

	Sometimes, you swear it's smiling at you. You constantly imagine how incredible sitting on that chair would be. But something stops you – some basic mammalian instinct. It looks too comfortable.

	You try to get some sleep, and the chair appears in your dreams.

	In your dreams, the chair has a face. At the bottom of the jelly-blob, where it begins to curve downward, you swear there's a face. It's smiling at you.

	Later, when you check in a waking state, you can't find any evidence of a face. Pareidolia, perhaps.

	But then you start to hear a voice. It's a whisper at first. But over time it becomes clearer, and more persuasive.

	@chatStart:jellychair_neutral
	sit on me :)

	@chatEnd:null

	The voice is soft and squeaky, like it's some tiny creature on your shoulder, or a voice inside your head. But you're sure it's not your own mind playing tricks on you.

	It's the chair.

	Suddenly, there is a war inside your mind. As you think about the exquisite comfort the mass of jelly and wood could provide, your instincts fight hard to resist.

	Eventually, after some long bouts of staring at the chair, your instincts win out. At the end of your long sojourn of the mind, the chair is firmly registered as a threat.

	But you just can't bear to get rid of it.

	It’s just after midday, and the midnight sun has been beating down for hours. The humidity is making it feel like being steamed alive. You are hunkered down in the shade, sucking on the least rotten, least mutated fruit you could find, waiting for night to come.

	You hear the soft shuffling of footsteps and turn your head to get a look at whoever’s walking up.

	@audioPlay:uriah
	@image:uriah

	The source of the footsteps looks to be an old frog-man, walking slowly, carrying a staff and wearing robes.

	Wearing ROBES? In THIS weather? Heavy ones, too. Something about them is familiar, but you can’t quite place where you’ve seen robes like that.

	You inquire about how they’re faring with the heat.

	@chatStart:uriah_happy	
	Doing fine! Thank you! And how are you doing?
	@chatEnd:null

	You’re a little taken aback by just how cheery and energetic they seem given the conditions, but you assure them that you’re doing fine too.

	@chatStart:uriah_happy
	Glad to hear it!

	@chatEnd:null

	At this point you recognise the robes – the characteristic purple and that heavy material. You ask if they are a Sage.

	@chatStart:uriah_happy
	I am indeed – and rather happy to be one! My name is Sage Uriah.

	@chatEnd:null

	The Wandering Sages are the stuff of legend: wise beings who have walked far and wide, accumulating the collective wisdom of the Froglands, and even that of lands beyond.

	@chatStart:uriah_neutral
	I hope you don’t mind, I was feeling a bit peckish and in need of rest. I was hoping to sit at the shore here and hopefully catch some flies!

	@chatEnd:null

	You indicate that you, indeed, don’t mind – but wait…flies? You had heard that the Sages only ate fruits and mushrooms, and abstained from eating animals, even bugs.

	@chatStart:uriah_neutral
	A piece of fruit, a fly – what difference does it make?

@chatStart:uriah_satisfied
	You eat something, and that thing stops being what it was and becomes a part of you.

	@chatStart:uriah_happy
	One day, you’ll stop being you and become a part of something else. Everyone does it. The whole universe does!

	@chatEnd:null

	The old frog sits down with their legs in the water, and, while talking to you, eyes the flies hovering within reach of their tongue.

	@chatStart:uriah_happy
	The flies I’ve met don’t much mind becoming part of a frog. To them, it’s just the next thing in life.

	As a Sage, that is a very wise perspective to learn from. I aspire to be as open to life as the flies!

	…speaking of…

	@chatEnd:null

	Uriah flicks out their tongue and captures a fly dead-on, drawing it back into their mouth without hesitation. You can’t help but find the scene a little morbid, but the old frog grins broadly at you, seemingly oblivious.

	But then, they notice your discomfort, and their expression becomes more sombre.

	@chatStart:uriah_neutral
	I see the darkness in it, too. Those flies were just as alive as you or I, and I silently mourn every one.

	But what am I gonna do? I’m a frog! I eat flies. Nothing in this world stays forever, no matter how precious, how sacred. And when I die, the flies will get their revenge!

	@chatEnd:null

	They smile at you again, cheesily. This time you smile back.

	@chatStart:uriah_neutral
	We live in a time of much uncertainty, turmoil, and change.

	There are many who have a hard time adjusting to new circumstances; mutations, changing ideas about the world…

	…but life? Life is always the same. Life is change.

	@chatEnd:null

	They pause, and close their eyes, turning away to feel a gust of wind from over the lake.

	@chatStart:uriah_neutral
	Whatever changes may happen, it is only the natural expiration, renewal and evolution of forms. The universe will be just as whole as it always is.

	@chatEnd:null

	A long moment of silence passes, and the old sage continues to soak in the breeze. It’s inspirational – and you find yourself enjoying the scenery just a little more than you did before.

	You're preparing some food when the first of the blurry shapes flits overhead. Then there's another, and another, and then they become hard to ignore.
	
	Before long, it's a black mass in the sky, and you know what it is. The mosquito-people are starting their annual migration, leaving their swampy hives to find warmer weather to the north.
	
	But they seem more hurried than usual. There's an erratic energy to their movement that's unusual to see. But still, the shifting swarm of migrants twists toward the horizon.
	
	It's a beautiful sight, even if their haste makes you wonder if you should also be fleeing.
	
	@audioPlay:weapons
	
	Just as you consider the thought of packing up your belongings and following, something falls from the swarm.
	
	It splashes into the water beside the pyre, and disappears beneath the ripples. A dozen other items follow quickly after it, landing around the camp.
	
	Something small and round falls right in front of you.
	
	It passes through your vision in a split second, and lands with a heavy metallic clang on the surface of the table you were preparing food at.
	
	What you see when you look down is not what you expect to see.
	
	@image:weapons
	
	It's a turtle. With a knife strapped to its back.
	
	The knife is embedded in the wood, leaving the turtle to hang upside down. It cranes its neck up to see you, and you share a silent greeting.
	
	A nasally call from above breaks the strange tension between the two of you.
	
	Hovering outside the stream of flying bodies, a mosquito woman shouts down an apology, and adds that you can keep the things she dropped before promptly disappearing back into the swarm.
	
	Shortly after, the dark cloud departs, and you're left with your strange new gift. It seems only polite to unstick the knife and place the turtle upright.
	
	It doesn't do much else but stare at you. Given the knife, it's a little intimidating.
	
	Eventually, you place the turtle on the grass of the knolls around the pyre, and go about searching for the other items that fell.
	
	It doesn't take long to find them, and it quickly becomes clear that there's a common theme: they're all weapons.
	
	There's a club with a nasty-looking nail. A sword with a second blade tied onto the end, and a root-blade that has begun to germinate.
	
	What you have is the beginnings of a small arsenal - one which could be used to arm and defend the camp, if it grows to be any larger.
	
	You feel compelled to place the collected weapons next to the turtle, and it seems pleased with the responsibility of becoming the camp's de facto quartermaster.
	
	As the turtle settles into its role, you offer it some of the food you were preparing, but it refuses. It seems perfectly capable of fending for itself.
	
	In fact, you’re pretty sure you’re only alive because the turtle allows it.

	@chatStart:egbert_neutral
	You know, I almost died. Like, this morning.

	@chatEnd:null

	Despite the perilous nature of this comment, the sense of calm in neither the person, nor the environment so much as wavers.

	@chatStart:egbert_neutral

	The whole rest of my crew died. They absolutely bit it, yeah.

	I’m a krill farmer. Super dangerous job, as you can imagine.

	One of my crewmates messed up the song we use to sedate the krill. She sneezed.

	@chatEnd:null

	For the first time you see Egbert frown, and you feel a deep, intense anger coming from her. It’s like she’s mad at the whole universe. But somehow the calm is not disrupted by this either. Not in the slightest.

	@chatStart:egbert_mad
	It was a bloodbath…

	…I was the only one to survive.

	@chatEnd:null
	
	You’re not sure what to say to that.

	Egbert smiles again, then points to her loincloth.
	
	@chatStart:egbert_neutral
	Do you mind if I take this off?
	@chatEnd:null
	
	You’re not sure what to say to that, either.
	
	@chatStart:egbert_smug

	She does, and you just have to live with the fact you didn’t object.

	It comes time to go beyond the camp to forage for some midday grub.

	@audioPlay:foraging-no-sfx

	In the nearby woods, you unexpectedly find yourself in unfamiliar surroundings. Things aren’t where they used to be, and after scanning the area for any recognisable landmarks, you quickly concede that you are lost.

	Trudging onward in the hope of somehow finding your way again, you stumble into a small clearing by a river. There’s a modest wooden hut, with a thatched roof and smoke rising from a cobblestone chimney.

	Whoever lives there could help you find your way home – but they could also be hostile. There are stories of creatures practising dark magic in these woods.

Feeling bold, you knock on the door. Moments later, you are greeted by a short slug-woman with long eye stalks and tentacles.

By her tattered black shawl and the characteristic pointed black hat, you are certain that this slug-woman is, indeed, a practitioner of the dark arts. Judging by the large bubbling cauldron over her fire, she is a soup-witch, to be precise.

	Though you would expect to run, you find yourself oddly unshaken. Perhaps it’s the witch’s disarming appearance, or her curious gaze. Regardless, you gather your courage and ask the soup-witch for directions.

	The soup-witch laughs gleefully, and gives you directions back to the lake in a sing-song rhyme. The directions are clear and the riddle is easy to remember, so you move to thank the witch and go on your way.

	Before you can get out the first word, however, the witch speaks again.

	@chatStart:soupwitch_sly
	You look like someone who likes riddles and games!
	I propose a wager – I’ll ask you three riddles, and if you can answer a single one, I’ll grant you a gift!
	But beware. Fail all three, and I will cook you into my soup.
	@chatEnd:null

	You speak only a syllable of protest before she expresses her delight that you’ve agreed to play along, and starts reciting the first riddle with a flair and a gleam in her eye.

	@chatStart:soupwitch_neutral
	An egg, an oil, an acid,
	Makes quite a creamy treat,
	But to bring back what was put in,
	You'll have to perform this feat!
	@chatEnd:null

	You consider your answer…

	* [“Milk?”] -> cauldron_part_1
	* [“Layers?”] -> cauldron_part_1
	* [“Uhhh…”] -> cauldron_part_1

=== cauldron_part_1 ===

The soup-witch cackles with glee.

	@chatStart:soupwitch_cackle
	Demulsification!
	@chatEnd:null

	You've never heard that word. You can only guess that it's the name of a dark arts technique.

	She grins widely as she begins the next riddle.

	@chatStart:soupwitch_sly
	Too cold and it stays white,
	Too hot and it gets black,
	But at just the right heat, this happens,
	And makes a sweet brown snack!
	@chatEnd:null

	You consider your answer…

	* [“Chocolate?”] -> cauldron_part_2
	* [“Heat?”] -> cauldron_part_2
	* [“Uhhh…”] -> cauldron_part_2

=== cauldron_part_2 ===

	She shakes her head and tuts at you before revealing the answer in a sing-song voice.

	@chatStart:soupwitch_neutral
	Caramelization!
	@chatEnd:null

	You feel like you could have guessed that one – you've seen caramels before. You weren’t much of a fan of the tasteless clear film.

	@chatStart:soupwitch_sly
	My next riddle is the most challenging one yet!
	You'd better think long and hard about it if you want to avoid being soup.
	@chatEnd:null

	There's a frightening glee on her face when she sees how nervous you're getting.

	She takes a deep breath and recites the last riddle.

	@chatStart:soupwitch_neutral
	SOYBEAN OIL, WATER, BUTTERMILK, VINEGAR, SUGAR, EGG YOLKS, SALT, CONTAINS LESS THAN 2% OF WHEY (FROM MILK), MODIFIED FOOD STARCH, DRIED ONION, MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE, PHOSPHORIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, SORBIC ACID AND CALCIUM DISODIUM EDTA (TO PROTECT FLAVOR), DRIED GARLIC, SPICES, POLYSORBATE 60.
	What am I?
	@chatEnd:null

	* [“What?”] -> cauldron_part_3
	* [“No idea.”] -> cauldron_part_3
	* [“Uhhh…”] -> cauldron_part_3

=== cauldron_part_3 ===

	With a dire look on her face, she informs you that the answer is, in fact…

	@chatStart:soupwitch_neutral
Buttermilk ranch!
@chatEnd:null

	So, that’s it. You’ve heard three riddles and failed to answer a single one correctly. You prepare for the worst.

	But the soup-witch’s malicious expression suddenly gives way to a burst of gleeful cackling, and she places a reassuring tentacle on your shoulder.

	@chatStart:soupwitch_neutral
	Soup-witches don’t cook living creatures. Not usually.
	Besides, you’re not plump enough to be worth your broth.
	Apologies for pulling your leg, dear.
	I’m wont for a little company and mischief, out here in these woods.
	@chatEnd:null

	After establishing that you’re free to go, the witch offers you her cauldron as a gift. You try to politely refuse, claiming that it would be too bulky to transport back to the camp, but she finds a simple solution.

	@image:cauldron

	With a wave of the witch’s hands, the cauldron fades from existence. She assures you that she’s delivered it to your camp, and sends you off with a satchel of some pungent spices and some exotic ingredients you’ve never laid eyes upon.

	@chatStart:soupwitch_neutral
	Farewell, dear. Thank you for being a good sport!
	And remember: a good meal is a gift meant to be shared with others.
	@chatEnd:null

	With that, you set off back to camp, and quickly find your way out of the woods.

	When you return, the heavenly aroma of fresh broth has filled the camp. You try not to think about what peculiar ingredients and dark magicks went into the cauldron to make it so appetising.

=== plant ===

	A few hours pass.


	It’s a warm night; you’re sitting enjoying the sounds of the crickets, and you’re just about to go to bed when you hear a rustling nearby.

	@audioPlay:waterways

	A haggard old frog stumbles through the brush, clutching a plant in a pot. His eyes meet yours, and after a momentary pause his expression goes from exhaustion to relief as he rushes over to you.

	@image:plant

	When he gets to you, he wordlessly shoves the potted plant into your arms and asks you to please take care of it for him. He wears a kind smile, but there’s a deep sense of solemn desperation in his eyes.

	After you barely indicate that you will take care of the plant, he throws his arms up in glee and proceeds to walk off into the woods, clasping his hands together and muttering cheerfully.

	You ask him to please stay, rest a while. You offer him some of your stew, but he refuses your offers. He says he won’t be needing things like stew, where he’s going.

	Before long he’s disappeared into the brush again, and in resignation, you turn to the plant in your arms. Something new to take care of.

	You try to place it in several different spots around the camp, and every time you move it, it readjusts its stalk to turn its petals away from the light of the pyre.

	Once, while moving it, something sticky and wet drops on your arm. After closer inspection, it seems to be nectar from the flower. It drips off the bulb, but you dare not peel back the petals.

	Out of curiosity, you decide to taste the nectar. It’s thick, overly sweet, and strangely…fizzy. You theorise that if you spread it on a tray and left it out to dry, it might make for an excellent snack.
	
	Thankfully, you come to find that the plant is not hard to maintain.

	When the plant hasn’t been watered enough, its nectar becomes dry and yellowish. Its leaves will droop and whither if it hasn’t received enough moonlight.

	You conclude that it’s an excellent addition to your collection of ephemera.

@chatEnd:null

	The new visitor to the camp comes out of nowhere, and suddenly he's lounging in the jelly-chair.

@chatStart:pecksniff_neutral
Looks like a chill place to hang. If it's cool, I'll kick it here for a bit.

@chatEnd:null

	Before the jelly-chair has a chance to even think about enveloping him, the visitor has jumped back to his feet.

@chatStart:pecksniff_doubt
Oh, soz. Where's me manners? Didn't even introduce meself, did I?

@chatEnd:null

	He lets the question linger for longer than he should. It's possible he was genuinely trying to remember whether he had made an introduction.

@chatStart:pecksniff_neutral
Nah, I didn't.
@chatEnd:null

	Apparently he did forget.

@chatStart:pecksniff_doubt
Sorry, had a bit of a wild time. Nearly drowned earlier, ay.
@chatEnd:null

	Nearly drowned?

@chatStart:pecksniff_neutral
Yeah, we was surfing on an old door we found. Well, stole. Technically.
@chatEnd:null

	Evidently, the visitor is a bit of a rascal. He wanders around the camp, nodding in mercifully quiet respect at the various items and residents.

@chatStart:pecksniff_excited
Nice place ya got here. Name's Pecksniff, ay.
@chatEnd:null

	Finally, a name to put to the whirling dervish – maybe it might come in use if you need to shout him down from climbing up the tower wall.

	It's a little exhausting just to be in Pecksniff's presence, but it's not an unpleasant experience. Without a doubt, the snail-man is the most socially active visitor to the camp.

	He swaggers back around to you, and holds out a hand. In his palm is a small, colourful, oval-shaped object.

@chatStart:pecksniff_neutral
Can I interest you in a party hat?
@chatEnd:null

	What he offers certainly doesn't look like any party hat you've ever seen. It looks more like a piece of candy…except pulsing, and gelatinous. It looks alive.

@chatStart:pecksniff_doubt
You sure?
@chatEnd:null

	Pecksniff apparently assumed your answer was 'no', and briefly tries to convince you otherwise.

@chatStart:pecksniff_neutral
It'll make you see faster, ay.
@chatEnd:null

@chatStart:pecksniff_doubt
But you know, it's cool if you don't want one. Use responsibly and all that.
@chatEnd:null

	It's only then that you notice the similarly multi-coloured protrusions atop Pecksniff's head pulse. He awaits an answer.

	Do you want a party hat?

	* [“Yes.”] -> pecksniff_choice_take
	* [“No.”] -> pecksniff_choice_refuse
	
=== pecksniff_choice_take ===

@chatStart:pecksniff_excited
Hell yeah, hell yeah.
@chatEnd:null

	Pecksniff plops the blob on your head, and in an instant, the world melts away. Gravity seems to reverse, and in a rush of light, you find yourself in a cavern.

	Around you, there are dozens of peculiar, pulsating sacs. An overwhelming sense of bliss radiates from them, and each undulates with a bespoke ringed pattern of impossible hues.

	It takes a moment for him to become perceptible, but you notice that Pecksniff is also in the cave – only he's younger, with a mullet and the unmistakable attitude of an unimpressed teenager. The colourful lumps atop his head are also gone.

	He wanders through the stony hall, and quickly takes an interest in the colourful sacs. He reaches out to touch them, and at the moment he does, the vision melts away.

@chatStart:pecksniff_excited
Oh, ay. I just felt ya peepin’ in my noodle. That was the day the party started!
@chatEnd:null

	Pecksniff’s voice precedes the reassembly of the world around you, and when you’re back at the camp, it all seems different. There’s a glow to everything, and the light on the water and in the pyre seems to glimmer differently.

	You have an slightly unnerving but blissful, overwhelming urge to boogie.

->pecksniff_end

=== pecksniff_choice_refuse ===

@chatStart:pecksniff_neutral

@chatEnd:null

	Pecksniff tosses the blob over his shoulder, and you hear a splash as it sinks into the water. You think you catch sight of it starting to dissolve, but your attention is quickly snapped back to the unstoppable visitor.

@chatStart:pecksniff_neutral
Ya don’t need any a’that to have a good time, ay!

	It’s true. You’re not sure if your life would’ve been improved by the invasion of some kind of party-obsessed brain parasite – though it seems to work for Pecksniff.

=== drone ===

	~ decorationCount += 1

	CRASH.

	It comes out of nowhere – an explosion of sound and soil, accompanied by a flurry of flying metal debris. With incredible violence, something has landed in the middle of your camp.
	
	You see it strike the earth, and there's a split second before the air quickly starts to fill with dust and smoke where you can see what it is. It's a machine.
	
	@audioPlay:drons-lament
	@image:musicDron
	
	Luckily, there's no damage done to anyone or anything besides the ground. But still, the sudden shock is disorienting. And it only gets more disorienting once the klaxon starts.
	
	It screeches three quick, abrasive tones, pauses, then loops – the sounds emerging from the smoke like the cries of a dying animal.
	
	Eventually, the animal dies. Its cries slow and slur until the loops start to stutter. Then they stop.
	
	Not long after, the smoke clears, and the thing that fell from the sky is fully revealed. Now, it looks like a heap of metal, but there are some familiar shapes.
	
	You recognise the object from tales you’ve heard – tales of a compound in the north that people call Dronpor. This is – was – one of its residents: a sleepless killing machine powered by the sun.
	
	The most common advice given regarding Dronpor is to avoid. it. No-one knows what the machines' purpose is, but they fiercely protect their territory. Nothing good to be found there, folks say, just flying death.
	
	Some have said they've seen the machines moving back and forth beyond the clouds. Whatever they do up there is anyone's guess.
	
	The flyer that has crash-landed in the camp must have come from far up. If you squint, you can see a trail of black smoke leading down to your camp from the dark skies above.
	
	Your gaze returns to the machine, and suddenly, some part of it reactivates. A glowing red eye locks onto you.
	
	You freeze, and brace yourself for annihilation.
	
	Moments pass. Time enough to make peace with your untimely end, but it doesn't come. Instead, the eye only glows brighter, accompanied by a high-pitched whine.
	
	You consider running for cover, finding some boulder to hide behind in the hopes that the monstrous robot doesn't simply shatter it into a rain of gravel.
	
	But still, nothing happens. The whine only climbs in pitch as the mechanical iris regards you with murderous intent. At least, that's what you assume. It looks angry.
	
	As the machine struggles to kill you, the stammering klaxon you heard earlier starts up again. It almost seems to harmonise with the whining, creating a disjointed electronic melody.
	
	After a while, you come to the conclusion that the machine poses no threat. You also become certain there's no way to turn it off.
	
	Hours pass like this, with the machine making its miserable mechanical music. The hunk of twisted metal is too heavy and too unwieldy to move, so you just leave it there.
	
	You're quite sure that the metal melody is a sign that the machine is trying to kill you. Occasionally it gives up, only to resume its attempts once your back is turned. But you get used to it.
	
	By the time dawn starts to break, you catch yourself humming along with it and smiling.

=== bunting ===

	A few hours pass.


	The sound of familiar music grows steadily in the distance. It's faint at first, but the sound is unmistakable: the song of the circus.
	
	The thrumming of drums, the parping of horns, and the joyful chanting – it's a rare sound, but a welcome one. The Froglands are seldom blessed with a visit from the circus.

	@audioPlay:waver

	There are a dozen settlements nearby, but none big enough to play host to the troupe. They're likely on their way to fairer and more prosperous lands.
	
	Still, even in passing, there's something to see, songs to hear, and joy to be drawn from the simple, temporary presence of the circus.
	
	From the campsite, you have a good view of the trade route that the circus will pass along. Already, if you squint, you can see the head of the procession.
	
	The lead vehicle is gigantic, with huge, powerful front wheels and a long, segmented caterpillar track at the rear. A dozen other jalopies follow behind.
	
	Each member of the caravan has some kind of platform affixed to the top; as the parade gets closer, the blurry figures atop them resolve into the shapes of performers.
	
	Aboard a vehicle that seems more like a boat with wheels, there are clowns with elaborate headdresses, and riding on outriggers, magicians that cast puffs of fire into the air.
	
	From scaffold towers mounted on the backs of other vehicles, trapeze artists swing and guidons wave colourful flags, catching the eye of wanderers far and wide.
	
	By now, the convoy has attracted a small crowd on the wayside. Other denizens have crawled out of their bivouacs and hidey-holes, leaving the safety and comfort of their camps to witness the spectacle.
	
	All along the road, the spectators cheer as the parade passes by. The ringmaster – a squat, five-eyed fellow with a peg-leg and an enormous hat – receives their praise with gratitude, bowing and clasping her hands together.
	
	Behind the ringmaster, standing together beneath a pergola, high up on one of the parade floats, there are an assortment of clowns, performers and dancers all wearing broad smiles and waving.
	
	It's a wistful sight. Only those talented enough to travel with the circus are allowed to join. Those that do enjoy free meals, protection in numbers, and tutelage in arts – such as clownery – that would otherwise be lost to time.
	
	You watch in bittersweet awe as the entertainers give their final performances before moving beyond your sight. Before long, the convoy has moved past your camp, and yet still you watch as they depart.
	
	The circus is moving steadily into the distance by the time you catch sight of the shimmering shape approaching from their direction. It's a flutter of bright colour against the twilight sky – a dozen triangles of red, flying back toward you.
	
	They land in a heap on the muddy road, where the ground has been thoroughly churned by the tracks and wheels of the convoy. But the crimson colour seems brighter than ever. It takes a second to realise what they are.
	
	They're pieces of hessian canvas, cut into flags and stained red with some kind of brilliant dye, strung together on a piece of plastic wire.
	
	You quickly run down to the road to collect them, and a few of the remaining onlookers regard you with jealousy. It takes a few tense moments to gather up the flags before you quickly make your way back to your camp, taking care not to let them drag behind you.
	
	Back at the pyre, you admire the craftsmanship of the string of flags. There's no doubt it came from the circus, and you almost feel bad for not trying to return it to them.
	
	But the bunting serves as such a sweet reminder of the joy that the circus can bring that, despite what your senses tell you, you swear you can still hear their song.
	
	You decide to hang the bunting, and after a perilous climb up the monstrous ribs that protrude from the lake, you almost feel like a circus performer yourself.

@image:bunting

	It takes a little while to find a way to secure them properly, but once you're back on the ground, it's clear that it was the right decision.
	
	Perhaps the magnificence of the bunting will attract the jealousy of your neighbours, or perhaps it will signal to other weary travellers that your pyre is a welcoming place to unwind and recuperate from the stresses of the world.
	
	But, most of all, it's a joy to have a decoration that inspires a smile each time you lift your gaze to the sky.

	Something shifts – you're not sure what – and a moment of calm descends.

	{decorationCount > 2: ->ending_decorations|->ending_companions}

=== ending_companions ===

	The camp is abuzz with chatter. The handful of characterful companions you've gathered trade in tales of their lives, in strange rumours and in talk of hope for the future.

	In this twilight world, where so little can be taken for granted, this queer little band of strangers is something to hold onto.

	There's no guarantee anyone will stay, and it would be wrong to try to make them. But for now it seems that everyone is content to share in each other's joy. For now, at least, you have them.

	When you first came to this quiet spot beside the mottled lake, you were unsure if it would be somewhere you could stay. It hardly felt hospitable, but now it feels alive.

	And it was your newfound friends that made it such a comfortable place of safety. The thought occurs that you should tell them so – tell them, with love and gratitude, that they made it feel like home.

->END

=== ending_decorations ===

	The camp is quiet, but full of stories. In this place, each item holds significance; each is a part of your tapestry – the things you've done, the things you've seen, and the spirit of the world around you.

	Few people in this world are lucky enough to amass so many storied possessions. It's not like the world before, where the accumulation of things became a meaningless hobby.

	With the objects you've gathered, you have the means to stay here for a good while – to defend yourself, to stay healthy, and to not go mad with boredom.

	Perhaps you will stay, comfortable in your simple bulwark. Perhaps you'll share your comforts with passers-by, and find your calling as a storyteller visited by travellers on their way to parts unknown.

	Such dreams would be impossible without the security of this little oasis you've built for yourself. What was once a desolate corner of the world is now something to be proud of – to protect. You made it feel like home.
